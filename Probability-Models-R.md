This R! Exsersive will use data from the "Two way Tables" worksheet.

This is the first problem in the worksheet. 
 
 1. Who eats breakfast? 
 Students in an urban school were curious about how many children regularly eat breakfast.
 They conducted a survey, asking, “Do you eat breakfast on a regular basis?” 
 All 595 students in the school responded to the survey. The resulting data are shown in the two-way table.
